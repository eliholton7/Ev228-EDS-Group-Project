# Ev228 EDS Group Project
EDS Group Project

This project is focused on making figures of the average fork length of the Pacific Halibut, along with the average weight, from 1998 to 2025. Two of the figures are bar charts while the other is a line chart. 
All that is needed to generate the figures used in the presentation is to run the 3 .py scripts labeled: EDS_Group_Project.py, halibut_fl_graph.py, and halibut_kgs_graph.py. The other .py scripts are either functions that were being played with to see how they worked or whether they could be involved in the code writing process, or different attempts to create certain graphs or mess around with graph mechanics. 

Code Index:
EDS_Group_Project.py: plots average fork length over years and shades the x axis up ot the graph line. 
halibut_fl_graph.py: plots average fork length over years as a bar chart to represent the data more clearly. 
halibut_kgs_graph.py plots average weight over years as a bar chart. 
Halibut_data_graphs.py: used to mess around with graph mechanics as well as test code and make first versions of graphs. 
fun_GHCN_data.py: function to import GHCN data and pick a data point to print. Was originally tested on EDS_Group_Project.py but then discarded. 

Generative AI was not used in any of the code in this repository.
